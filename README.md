Installation and Starting
In order for app to work, it is necessary to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can learn how to do that by visiting Node.js site.

Once you have it installed and the app is downloaded, you need to navigate in your terminal and run:

$ npm install command This will install all required dependencies.

Now it's time to run the app by executing the command:

$ npm start
in the same folders as before (in your terminal).

Provided everything went well, the app is now running! :)

Usage
I've decided to implement basic frontend using React.js. The API service itself was tested with Postman.

Once the app is up and running, you can visit the home page at: http://localhost:3000.
